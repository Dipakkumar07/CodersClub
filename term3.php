<h4><span>REQUIREMENTS</span></h4>
    Rent-Acoder shall have absolute discretion as to whether or not it accepts a particular applicant of site for<br> participation in the service.

<h4>REGISTRATION</h4>
    By registering on Our website You agree to Terms of Use and conditions of this page and you agree that you have<br> read them.

<h4><span>PICKING A WINNER FOR A PROJECT</span></h4>
     At the moment you select one or more applicants, on your project, as winners, We charge you a fee of $5 or %5<br> from the selected freelancers bid amounts. You shall discuss the project details and settle on a contract with the<br> freelancer, on the project message board, before you award the project. At the moment You already selected one<br> or more freelacer(s), the system exchanges Your contact details and the project is closed from Our point of view.

<h4><span>PLACING BIDS</h4></span>
    When You place a bid on a project, You agree that we will charge you a fee of $5 or %5 of Your bid in the moment<br> the project provider selects Your bid as winner. If You wish not to be selected as a winner, it is up to Your<br> discression to remove Your bid from the project.

<h4><span>DEPOSITS INTO ACCOUNT</h4></span>
  Each deposit into the account is charged with a non-refundable flat fee of $1.
<h4><span>REMOVAL FROM NETWORK</h4></span>
  Rent-Acoder reserves the right to terminate the participation of any member or site without reason but expressly<br> including any member site that Rent-Acoder judges to be in violation of the Terms and Conditions. Members in<br> violation of Rent-Acoder's Terms and Conditions will be immediately deactivated. Rent-Acoder may deactivate<br> members with no prior notification. Members found in violation of the Terms and Conditions will not receive any<br> credit or payment from Rent-Acoder. Members that are terminated by Rent-Acoder on any basis other than violation<br> of these Terms and Conditions will be entitled to receive any payment due from Rent-Acoder.

<h4><span>PAYMENTS</h4></span>
  Rent-Acoder will typically make payments/withdrawals if the member requests it AND their account balance is<br> equal to or greater than $5. All amounts are stated in and all payments will be made in US funds. We verify all<br> deposits and might ask you to verify yours; If you refuse to send verification information via E-mail, Fax or<br> Phone, we reserve the right to refund the deposit and terminate your account. Rent-Acoder reserves the right to<br> suspend a withdrawal if the source of the funds is suspected to be fraudulent. Any funds received from an account<br> having made a fraudulent deposit (e.g. stolen credit card) will be reversed immediately. If in a fraudulent<br> payment situation a withdrawal has already been processed, you will be expected to return the funds to your Rent-<br>Acoder account or face account termination and legal actions towards you. Rent-Acoder cannot be held liable for<br> deposits reversed without its authorization due to reasons, including, but not limited to, fraud, chargebacks or<br> complaints. Rent-ACoder reserves the right to earn interest from its service provider banks or others arising from<br> the processing of payments. Rent-ACoder is prohibited by law from paying interest to members in respect of any<br> balance held in member's account. Rent-Acoder may request proof of programming services performed at any time<br> before authorizing a withdrawal of funds received for that project. As previously stated, any member site that<br> Rent-Acoder removes from the service due to violation of the Terms and Conditions will receive no credit or<br> payment.

<h4><span>DISPUTES</h4></span>
  Members may not file a complaint with one of our payment processors, PayPal, regarding the funds deposited into<br> their account. Rent-Acoder staff will do its best to resolve any problem a member may have. Refunds will be<br> processed, if deemed necessary, at a time of Rent-Acoder staff's choosing. Due to the incompatible communication<br> systems between our payment processors and Rent-Acoder staff members, payment disputes logged directly with those<br> processors cannot be properly managed and will cause further delays. Due to this, members who make a complaint to<br> our payment processor will face account termination without notice. For any dispute you will email payments@rent-<br>acoder.com to request mediation by staff. Rent-Acoder reserves the right to use its own discretion to make <br>decisions in favor of a party and considers its decision final. A fee may be charged to reopen closed dispute<br> cases. Escrow payments will not be completed or cancelled by Rent-Acoder if the buyer (in the case of cancelling;<br> programmer in the case of completing) fails to contact Rent-Acoder support within 45 days after the project's<br> delivery date for projects with a delivery date from 0-7 days after project closing date; 60 days for projects<br> with a delivery date of 7-30 days; and 90 days for delivery dates of 30 or more days. Rent-Acoder reserves the<br> right to complete or cancel any escrow payments, if either party fails to reply to requests for information by<br> support staff, or if deemed necessary after review of a project dispute. Direct transfers and escrow payments<br> fully completed by the buyer are considered final and cannot be considered for reversal. In case of a project<br> dispute & cancellation, Rent-Acoder reserves the right to hold on to, depending on each case, at least 50% of the<br> fee charged for the project. The fee is considered a mediation, services & contact details exchange fee.

<h4><span>COPYRIGHTS</h4></span>
  No copyright material can be posted on Rent-Acoder. Only posting sections of articles or scripts, as examples,<br> will be permitted. A "section" being no more than 10% of the contents. This is meant to protect the author's<br> rights. We also do not tolerate projects that are clearly requesting unauthorized reproduction of copyrighted or<br> patented material. Rent´-ACoder canot held responsible for any copyright issues between the members.
  
<h4><span>MODIFICATIONS</h4></span>
  Rent-Acoder reserves the right to change the member Terms and Conditions at any time. It is the member's<br> responsibility to check these Terms and Conditions from time to time for such changes. In the event Rent-Acoder<br> offers any additional or replacement services then this agreement shall apply to such services in the absence of<br> any new agreement specific to such services which is entered into between the parties.

<h4><span>OWNERSHIP</h4></span>
  Members agree that all information contained on a website operated by Rent-Acoder, and all information compiled<br> by Rent-Acoder through operation of the affiliate program, is the proprietary information of Rent-Acoder.<br> Personal information provided by members to Rent-Acoder will be kept confidential and will not be distributed to<br>b any third party.
  
<h4><span>E-MAIL ADDRESSES</h4></span>
Members agree not to post their e-mail address on the site, except in the "e-mail" field of the signup form, or<br> when asked by Rent-Acoder at any other time. There should be no need to give anyone your e-mail address. Contact<br> details are automatically provided if you choose a programmer (or you are the programmer chosen for) a project,<br> and before that time you can use the message board to communicate. This does not only apply to e-mail addresses,<br> but to all methods of communication, including phone, ICQ, AIM, MSN Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, Skype, Gtalk, etc...<br> See "Avoiding Commissions" below for the reason.

<h4><span>PROVIDING CONTACT INFORMATION</h4></span>
  You are prohibited from making direct contact with another member, unless it's for a project you (a programmer)<br> have been picked for, or you (a buyer) have picked a programmer for. This includes giving out your e-mail address,<br> instant messenger, phone number, or any other method of contact outside of this site. Website addresses which<br> display or directly link to a members contact info are also not permitted. Rent-Acoder provides you with message<br> boards, which should be sufficient for pre-project planning. 

<h4><span>AVOIDING COMMISSIONS</h4></span>
  You are strictly prohibited from attempting to negotiate the fee for a project with another member directly<br> (outside of Rent-Acoder). This also applies to any project that was closed without a programmer being chosen, and<br> then contacting them about the project anyway. Both parties are responsible for notifying Rent-Acoder if the<br> payment amount increases (above the bid amount) after the project is closed. Receiving a larger amount than the<br> original project bid, without notifying us, will be considered an attempt to avoid the commissions. When a<br> programmer requests a withdrawal, we always review all payments received for each project to verify that they<br> match the bid. If at the time of a withdrawal request the programmer has failed to notify Rent-Acoder staff of a<br> payment received above the amount of his bid (a total payment above US$100), Rent-Acoder reserves the right to<br> deduct double the fee for the amount that should have been reported. We believe our commissions are very fair and<br> justified for the service we provide, therefore we will absolutely not tolerate any of this activity on Rent-<br>Acoder. Penalty fees will be charged to repeat offenders of the site terms, including for the posting of contact<br> info, for which double the fees that potentially would have been charged for a completed project will be charged<br> to the offender. The potential project fee will be determined by Rent-Acoder at its discretion, and will typically<br> incorporate the buyer's fee and the programmer's fee based on the bid. If no bid has been placed the fee may be<br> determined based on the project budget. Penalty fees charged to an offending member may be refunded if the<br> offendor eventually participates in that project on Rent-Acoder on which the violation was made, and pays the<br> regular project fees.

<h4><span>BIDDING</h4></span>
  Programmers can only place bids that equal the total amount of money they are requesting for the project.<br> You cannot post an hourly bid or any other abnormal type of bid. This applies to buyers too. Buyers cannot create<br> projects that directly or indirectly require programmers to place hourly or other abnormal bids.

<h4><span>ADVERTISING</h4></span>
  You are prohibited from advertising your website on Rent-Acoder. Any URL posted in a bid, project description,<br> or the message board, must relate to a project on Rent-Acoder. An example of a permissible URL: your portfolio orM<br> resumé page, without any contact information.

<h4><span>ACCOUNTS</h4></span>
  An individual may not possess more than one account, unless they have contacted and received authorization from<br> Rent-Acoder staff. Users found with unauthorized multiple accounts, or found to be using multiple accounts to<br> avoid bad reviews, fees, suspensions or other limitations, will face suspension of all their accounts. It is<br> prohibited under all circumstances to transfer ownership of an account, without authorization from Rent-Acoder<br> staff. Accounts that are inactive (have no login activity) for more than 12 months will be deactivated and have<br> their remaining funds deducted by Rent-Acoder.

<h4><span>THE ROLE OF RENT-ACODER</h4></span>
  Rent-Acoder functions as a venue to connect buyers and programmers in a virtual marketplace. As a neutral<br> facilitator, Rent-Acoder is not directly involved in the actual transactions between users of the Site. As a<br> result, Rent-Acoder has no control over the truth, accuracy, quality, legality, or safety of postings made by his<br> members. Because verifying the identity of a user on the Internet is difficult, Rent-Acoder cannot and does not<br> confirm the identity of users. Rent-Acoder also does not confirm nor verify the qualifications, background, or<br> abilities of users. Therefore, We recommend that You be careful and exercise common sense and good judgment when<br> dealing with any member on the Site. If you are unsatisfied with another member, the most Rent-Acoder can do is<br> refund the project commission you have been charged by us. We cannot refund the money you have sent to someone, we<br> are not responsible for your transactions. Rent-Acoder is not responsible for fraudulent payments made by users<br> and cannot be held liable for financial loss incurred from fraudulent transactions. It is the receiver's<br> responsibility to verify the identity and background of the sender.

<h4><span>LEGAL ISSUES</h4></span>
  Members are responsible for legal issues related to the work product or process and any postings on Rent-Acoder.<br> This site is governed by the laws of Bistrita, Romania. Any legal action against us shall take place in the<br> courts of Bistrita. The parties attorn to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of Bistrita.
